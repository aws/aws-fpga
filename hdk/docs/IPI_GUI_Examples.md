# IP Integrator Example Tutorial with AXI GPIO and AXI BRAM (hello\_world)

The IPI example turtorial will cover how to configure the AWS IP with the BAR1 Interface (AXI4-Lite Master Interface) and the PCIS Interface (AXI4 Master). 

The AXI GPIO IP is added to the design to control the VLED.  Also, the AXI BRAM is added to the design for the PCIS Interface (AXI4 Master).

The VLED is set based upon writing 0xAAAA into the AXI GPIO (0x0) slave register to drive VLED.  The value is read using the Verilog task tb.get\_virtual\_led or fpga-get-virtual-led on F1.

The PCIS Interfaces writes ASCII data into the AXI BRAM memory space and reads back from these address to print out “Hello World!” in simulation or on F1.

## Create Directory Structure and Vivado Project 

Change directories to hdk/cl/examples

Create a directory in examples like hello\_world\_vivado

Change directories into hello\_world\_vivado/

Start Vivado by typing vivado in the bash console.

Create a project any device by typing the following command in Vivado's TCL Tab.

create\_project -name hello\_world

Type in the following TCL command which changes the project settings for AWS and creates the block diagram with the AWS IP added.

aws::make\_ipi


## Configuring the Block Diagram


### Configuring AWS IP

Double click on the AWS IP block.  Under IP Interfaces select Use BAR1 Register Interface (M\_AXI\_BAR1), Use PCI Slave-access Interface (M\_AXI\_PCIS), and Use Auxiliary (non-AXI) Signal Ports.  This enables the AXI4-Lite Master Interface (for AXI GPIO), AXI4 Master Interface (for AXI BRAM) and the VLED/VDIP input/outputs.  Select OK.

The AWS IP is configured for one clock using the Group-A Clock with the default clock recipe which configures a 125 MHz clock.

### Adding/Configuring AXI GPIO

Right click in the canvas and select Add IP...  Search for AXI GPIO and double click on AXI GPIO.

In the canvas for axi\_gpio\_0, double click on the block to configure the IP.

In the Re-customize IP Dialog Box, under the GPIO section select All Outputs and GPIO Width of 16. Select OK.

### Adding/Configuring AXI BRAM

Right click in the canvas, and select Add IP...  Search for AXI BRAM and double click on AXI BRAM Controller.

In the canvas for axi\_bram\_ctrl\_0, double click on the block to configure the IP.

Set the Data Width to 512 and click OK.  This is to match the 512-bit data width of the PCIS AXI4 Master Interface.

### Connecting the Design
Select Run Connection Automation at the top of the Block Diagram in the green highlighted section.

Select axi\_bram\_ctrl\_0/BRAM\_PORTA and then BRAM\_PORTB and select Auto.  For axi\_bram\_ctrl\_0/S\_AXI, make sure Master is set to /f1\_inst/M\_AXI\_PCIS and the rest of the options are Auto.

Select axi\_gpio\_0/S\_AXI.  Make sure Master is set to /f1\_inst/M\_AXI\_BAR1 and the rest of the options are Auto.

The axi\_gpio\_0/GPIO will be manually configured after Run Connection Automation.

Select OK.

Expand axi\_gpio\_0/GPIO by select the +.  Connect gpio\_io\_o[15:0] on the f1\_inst block and make a connection to status\_vled[15:0] and Run Connection Automation.

### Address Editor Tab
Select the Address Editor tab on top of the block diagram.

The AXI BRAM instance is configured with 64K address space by default starting at address 0xC0000000.  The address space can be increased or decreased by selecting a different value for Range.

The AXI GPIO instance has a 4K address space which is reflected in the addressing for M\_AXI\_BAR1 which starts at 0x00000000.

# IP Integrator Design Modular Reference Tutorial with hello world RTL

## Overview

The hello\_world example demonstrates basic Shell-to-CL connectivity, memory-mapped register instantiations and the use of the Virtual LED and DIP switches. The hello\_world example implements two registers in the FPGA AppPF BAR0 memory space connected to the OCL AXI-L interface. The two registers are:

1. Hello World Register (offset 0x500)
2. Virtual LED Register (offset 0x504)

The logic for the original cl\_hello\_world example from github is contained in one RTL module (hello\_world.v).  In hello\_world.v, the top level ports are for AXI4-Lite interface, clock/reset and ports for VLED and VDIP which allows for IP packaging of the design and reuse with other flows/AXI4-Lite Master interfaces.  Note VIO logic is not included with this example from the original hello\_world.
