- Developers provide their code to AWS via encrypted placed-and-routed CL design checkpoints. 
- The process to generate CL checkpoints has been automated. A developer can go to 'design/PR_build' and execute 'make cl' from the command line. 
- Paths to developer source code can be specified in 'design/PR_build/developer/scripts/encrypt.tcl'. 
- To verify correctness of the placed-and-routed CL design checkpoint, a developer can execute 'make verify_cl' from 'design/PR_build'. This command emulates the build that is executed by AWS, and results in the generation of bitstreams that can be used for testing by the developer. 
- The design checkpoints and associated reports and bitstreams that are sent to AWS are contained under 'design/PR_build/aws/from_developer'.
- Various constraints have been provided under 'design/PR_build/aws/constraints' and 'design/PR_build/developer/constraints'. However, developers are free to add additional constraints during their build processes.
