# Hello World CL

This simple *hello_world* example builds a Custom Logic (CL) that will enable the instance to "peek" and "poke" registers in the memory space of the CL inside the FPGA.

Please read here for [general instructions to build the CL, register an AFI, and start using it on an F1 instance](./../README.md).

##Meta-data about this CL

The following table displays information about the CL that is required to register it as an AFI with AWS.
Alternatively, you can directly use a pre-generated AFI for this CL which you can associate to an instance or AMI.
