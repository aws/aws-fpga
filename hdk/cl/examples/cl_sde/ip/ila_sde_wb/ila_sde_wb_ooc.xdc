# This XDC is used only for OOC mode of synthesis, implementation
# User should update the correct clock period before proceeding further
# This constraints file contains default clock frequencies to be used during 
# out-of-context flows such as OOC Synthesis and Hierarchical Designs. 
# For best results the frequencies should be modified# to match the target 
# frequencies. 
# This constraints file is not used in normal top-down synthesis (the default flow of Vivado)
