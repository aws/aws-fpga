# Starting your own Custom Logic

The developer has two ways to start a new Custom Logic design:
 1) Copy one of the example directory from /hdk/cl/example, or
 2) Call `sh prepare_new_cl.sh`

In both cases, the developer should
*A) Set the environment variable CL_DIR pointing to directory where the CL is
*B) Keep AWS recommended directory structure for the $CL_DIR/build and $CL_DIR/design

Once your design is ready and you would like to start the build/create process, please refer to `$HDK_DIR/cl/CHECKLIST.txt` file to verify all the necessary steps are set
