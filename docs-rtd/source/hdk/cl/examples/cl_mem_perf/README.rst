Introduction
============

The CL_MEM_PERF is a customer reference design for F2 where the
objective is to demonstrate fine tuned data paths to HBM and DDR to
achieve maximum throughput to the memories. The example also
demonstrates datapath connectivity between Host, AWS Shell, Custom Logic
(CL) region in the FPGA, HBM and DDR DIMM on the FPGA card. Following
are the major highlights of CL_MEM_PERF design:

1.  Datapath to 64GB DDR and 16GB HBM through Shell’s PCIS Interface.
    DDR and HBM memories in the FPGFA are accessible from the Host on
    PF0-BAR4, as well as from the DMA engine in the XDMA_SHELL. Both
    these accesses show up as AXI4 transaction on PCIS interface which
    ultimately reach the targeted memory.
2.  Demonstrate the use of PCIM interface for applications where CL is
    the PCIe Requestor to the Host. This can also be used to test peak
    PCIe transfer rates between Host and FPGA over PCIM interface.
3.  Register access to various blocks through Shell’s OCL interface.
4.  1KB BRAM accessible through Shell’s SDA interface.
5.  Supports user defined interrupts generated by the CL.
6.  Demonstrate Virtual JTAG using debug cores and AMD Integrated Logic
    Analyzers.
7.  AXI4 Traffic Generators to test peak DDR4 performance.
8.  HBM Performance Kernels to test peak HBM performance. This example
    shows how the micro-architecture to saturate all 32 Channels of HBM,
    achieve timing closure at 450MHz and achieve peak performance close
    to the theoretical number described in `AMD/Xilinx HBM
    Userguide <https://docs.xilinx.com/r/en-US/pg276-axi-hbm/Raw-Throughput-Evaluation>`__
9.  Build scripts and constraints to create or manage pblock/placement
    and timing constraints.
10. Software runtime tests to exercise max performance to the HBM, and
    other tests to exercise DMA engine in the AWS Shell to perform data
    transfers between the Host and CL.

Overall, CL_MEM_PERF enables customers to quickly integrate their CL
accelerator designs to interface with various memories on the FPGA and
to use as reference to fine tune their CL performance.

Clocks and Reset
----------------

- clk_main_a0 (250 MHz) from Shell for majority of the design except for
  HBM.
- rst_main_n from Shell sync’d to clk_main_a0.
- clk_hbm_ref (100 MHz) from Shell as reference clock for HBM IP.
- HBM AXI3 interface is clocked by the 450MHz clock generated from the
  `AWS_CLK_GEN <./../../../common/lib/aws_clk_gen.sv>`__ block. The
  AWS_CLK_GEN block also generates several other clocks to match with
  the clock recipes supported in F1. Please refer to `AWS_CLK_GEN
  spec <./../../../docs/AWS_CLK_GEN_spec.md>`__ for details on this
  block. The `Clock Recipes User
  Guide <./../../../docs/Clock_Recipes_User_Guide.md>`__ describes
  various clock recipes available for F2 developers and options on
  configuring clocks dynamically. The user guide also describes porting
  of CL designs based on F1 clock recipes into F2.
- NOTE: There is a SW control register at `OCL offset
  0x300 <#ancHBMAxi4RegisterAddrSpace>`__ to reset only the HBM IP core.
  This reset register does not reset the whole CL_HBM_AXI4 block.

OCL
---

The `CL_MEM_OCL_DEC <design/cl_mem_ocl_dec.sv>`__ module converts OCL
32-bit AXI-L Interface to simple config bus interface. It consists of an
address decoder to access register space of various blocks. See `OCL
Address Mapping <#ancOCLRegisterAddressSpace>`__ for availble ranges.

PCIM
----

The `CL_PCIM_MSTR <../cl_dram_hbm_dma/design/cl_pcim_mstr.sv>`__ module
is connected to the 512-bit AXI4 PCIM interface. It consists of AXI4
Traffic Generator capable of issuing Read/Write requests to the Host
over the PCIe link. This block can also be used to test the peak PCIe
transfer rates across the PCIe link.

While this block is essentially a traffic generator, CL designers could
potentially swap this block with their custom Kernel that acts as a PCIe
Requestor to the Host Memory.

PCIS
----

The PCIS is a 512-bit AXI4 interface from the Shell which can be
accessed either by Host over PF0-BAR4, or by the XDMA engine in the AWS
Shell. The PCIS interface is used in CL_MEM_PERF example to provide
datapaths to the DDR and HBM memories in the FPGA. The address range to
access DDR and HBM memories is described in `PCIS Memory Address
Space <#ancPCISAddressSpace>`__.

The `CL_AXI_MSTR <../cl_dram_hbm_dma/design/cl_dram_dma_axi_mstr.sv>`__
module is another simple AXI4 traffic genertor whose traffic pattern and
access length can be configured using the registers. The AXI4 interface
from CL_AXI_MSTR and PCIS feed to CL_AXI_INTERCONNECT which ultimately
connects to DDR and HBM based on the access address request.

There are two MUXes - one along the datapath to DDR, and another MUX
along datapath to HBM. These MUXes default to connecting
CL_AXI_INTERCONNECT’s path to the target memories. However, setting
these MUXes enables traffic from the ATGs to the target memories. PCIS
path to the target memories is disabled when the MUXes are enabled.

DDR
---

AWS provides
`SH_DDR <../../../common/shell_stable/design/sh_ddr/synth/sh_ddr.sv>`__
that houses the DDR4 Controller specifically configured to the DDR DIMM
on the FPGA Card. The SH_DDR is also connected to the Shell's
sh_cl_ddr_stat\_\* ports to enable Shell to manage DDR calibration upon
CL AFI loads. The SH_DDR exposes an AXI4 512-bit interface for the CL
logic to perform Read/Write data tranfsers into DDR. Please refer to
`Supported_DDR_Modes.md <./../../../docs/Supported_DDR_Modes.md>`__ for
details on supported DDR configurations in ``sh_ddr.sv``.

HBM
---

F2 FPGA has on-chip HBM with a maximum capacity of 16GiB, accessible
through 32 AXI3 Channels running at a maximum clock speed of upto
450MHz. CL designs should leverage all the available channels and aim
for achieving timing closure of the interface at 450MHz to get the best
possible performance out of HBM. HBM offers theoretical max bandwidth of
460GB/s when traffic is active across all the 32 Channels with 450MHz
clock.

The `CL_HBM_AXI4 <design/cl_mem_hbm_axi4.sv>`__ module demonstrates an
use case for HBM traffic as shown in the block diagram below: |image1|

CL_HBM_AXI4 exposes an AXI4 512-bit interface and two Configuration
Interfaces clocked using the 250MHz clk_main_a0. The Host (PCIS) can
access HBM through this AXI4 Interface. The AXI4 interface then connects
to 512-to-256 bit width convertor, clock crossing convertors between
``clk_main_a0``\ (250 MHz) and HBM's AXI3 clock (max 450MHz), and
AXI4-to-AXI3 protocol convertor to ultimately connect to HBM AXI
Channel#0

The hbm_stat_bus is a simple config bus that connects to CL_HBM_WRAPPER
and facilitates access to the Reset Register inside the CL_HBM_WRAPPER
(mainly to reset HBM IP and check HBM read).

The hbm_kern_cfg_bus is a simple config bus to configure the HBM
Performance Kernels (CL_HBM_PERF_KERNEL)

In addition to providing a datapath from PCIS to HBM, the CL_HBM_AXI4
block also instantiates CL_HBM_PERF_KERNEL which is designed to maximize
the available bandwidth from HBM. It demonstrates the microachitecture
for Customer Kernels interfacing with HBM, supports multiple outstanding
transactions in the queue across all 32 channels, with AXI3 interface
running at 450MHz clock. This design provides clock domain crossing
mechanism, performance measurememt counters along with floorplan and
timing constraints to achieve easier timing cloure at 450 MHz.

CL_HBM_PERF_KERNEL consists of the following blocks:

- CL_KERNEL_CTL: This is the main controller for the Kernel. It is
  responsible for posting write/read requests and track pending
  transactions. The block is capable of producing write and read
  requests in parallel to saturate all the channels of HBM. Keeping the
  channels active is key for maximizing the available HBM bandwidth and
  CL_KERNEL_CTL achieves that by arbitrating and issues multiple
  outstanding requests.
- CL_KERNEL_REGS: Houses all the control and status registers including
  performance measurement counters.
- CL_KERNEL_REQ: This block is instantiated inside CL_KERNEL_CTL and is
  mainly responsible to perform Clock Domain Crossing of read/write
  requests from clk_main_a0 to clk_hbm domain. This block is replicated
  to server each channel of the HBM.
- CL_AXI_CTL: Contains the control logic and datapath required to serve
  the AXI3 read/write requests to the HBM core. This module accepts
  read/write requests from CL_KERNEL_REQ pipe and interface with HBM’s
  AXI3 interface. The entire block runs on clk_hbm domain. CL_AXI_CTL is
  replicated for each HBM channel. Note that, the AXI3 interface for
  channel#0 is muxed along with the AXI4 data path from the
  hbm_axi4_bus. Users should enable this mux such that the traffic from
  CL_AXI_CTL#0 drives into HBM Channel#0. Please see description for
  details.
- While the data is produced/consumed locally in this specific design,
  customers will be able to leverage the microarchitecture by feeding
  the data to/from CL_KERNEL_REQ and interfacing it to their data
  producer/consumer logic.

CL_HBM_WRAPPER:

- The CL_HBM_WRAPPER block houses the main HBM IP configured in 16GiB
  capacity with 32- AXI3 Channels running at 450MHz clk_hbm clock.
- The hbm_stats_bus config interface provides access to reset the MMCM
  and check if the HBM is ready. See registers in CL_HBM_AXI4 Register
  Address Space for details.

Please refer to `CL_HBM_AXI4 Register Address
Space <#ancHBMAxi4RegisterAddrSpace>`__ for details on register address
space and HBM memory address space.

SDA
---

The SDA interface is shared between two modules:

1. The `CL_SDA_SLV <../cl_dram_hbm_dma/design/cl_sda_slv.sv>`__ module
   provides access to a 1KB BRAM through SDA 32-bit AXI-L Interface.
2. The `AWS_CLK_GEN <./../../../common/lib/aws_clk_gen.sv>`__ module
   generates all the required clocks for the design. Please refer to
   `AWS_CLK_GEN spec <./../../../docs/AWS_CLK_GEN_spec.md>`__ for
   details on this block. The `Clock Recipes User
   Guide <./../../../docs/Clock_Recipes_User_Guide.md>`__ describes
   various clock recipes available for F2 developers and options on
   configuring clocks dynamically. The user guide also describes porting
   of CL designs based on F1 clock recipes into F2.

Interrupts
----------

The `CL_INT_SLV <../cl_dram_hbm_dma/design/cl_int_tst.sv>`__ module
implements simple mechanism to trigger MSIX interrupts to the host over
sh_cl_apppf_irq_req/ack interface. SW can check the status of the
interrupt triggers and also configure the interrupt masks. The
``interrupt_example()`` routine in
`test_dram_hbm_dma.c <./software/runtime/test_dram_hbm_dma.c>`__
demonstrates interrupts functionality.

Virtual JTAG
------------

The `CL_ILA <../cl_dram_hbm_dma/design/cl_ila.sv>`__ instantiates the
Debug Bridge IP required to support Virtual JTAG and the two example
ILAs. One ILA snoops the PCIS bus, whereas second ILA snoops DDR-AXI4
bus.

Simulations
===========

Please see more details on running simulations in this
`README <verif/README.md>`__

Software
========

DMA accesses rely on the `XDMA
driver <https://github.com/Xilinx/dma_ip_drivers>`__

The CL_MEM_PERF example includes runtime software to demonstrate working
DMA accesses. The runtime example is located `in the runtime
directory <software/runtime/test_dram_hbm_dma.c>`__

Following runtime tests are provided in the cl_mem_perf example:

.. _test_hbm_perf32c:

test_hbm_perf32.c
-----------------

This test runs traffic and measure HBM performance aggregated across all
32 HBM Channels.

.. _test_dram_hbm_dmac:

test_dram_hbm_dma.c
-------------------

This test runs a software test with data transfer with both DDR and HBM
enabled

.. _test_hbm_perf32c-1:

test_hbm_perf32.c
-----------------

This test exercises all 32 HBM Channels using data transfers from
HBM_PERF_KERNEL. Achieves 400+ GB/s of writes and read performance.

.. _test_aws_clk_genc:

test_aws_clk_gen.c
------------------

This test uses `CL_CLK_FREQ <design/cl_clk_freq.sv>`__ to measure the
clock frequencies from
`AWS_CLK_GEN <./../../../common/lib/aws_clk_gen.sv>`__ block

.. _test_clk_freqc:

test_clk_freq.c
---------------

This test uses AWS APIs to configure clock frequencies into
`AWS_CLK_GEN <./../../../common/lib/aws_clk_gen.sv>`__ block

Compile and run instructions
----------------------------

.. code:: bash

   cd $CL_DIR/software/runtime

   make all

   sudo ./test_dram_hbm_dma

.. _test_dram_hbm_dma_hwsw_cosimc:

test_dram_hbm_dma_hwsw_cosim.c
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This test runs a software test with HW/SW co-simulation enabled with
both DDR and HBM enabled.

.. _compile-and-run-instructions-1:

Compile and run instructions
----------------------------

.. code:: bash

   cd $CL_DIR/software/runtime

   make TEST=test_dram_hbm_dma_hwsw_cosim

   sudo ./test_dram_hbm_dma_hwsw_cosim

The test can be simulated with XSIM as follows.

.. code:: bash

   cd $CL_DIR/verif/scripts

   make C_TEST=test_dram_hbm_dma_hwsw_cosim

HBM Performance Tests
=====================

A runtime test is provided to measure HBM performance aggregated across
all 32 HBM Channels. The runtime test should be run on a real machine
consisting of F2 FPGA loaded with CL_MEM_PERF bitstreams. The runtime
test `test_hbm_perf32.c <software/runtime/test_hbm_perf32.c>`__
exercises `CL_HBM_PERF_KERNEL <design/cl_hbm_perf_kernel.sv>`__ module
to generate data across all 32 channels of the HBM running at 450MHz
speeds. The test configures to run traffic across all 32 channels. There
are config registers in CL_HBM_PERF_KERNEL that keep track of the number
of write/read requests that were serviced and timers during which the
CL_HBM_PERF_KERNEL was busy servicing the AXI3 Channels of HBM. The
runtime test reads these transaction counters to compute the aggregate
HBM performance across all the channels.
