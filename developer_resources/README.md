# Developer Resources

We provide the [FPGA Developer AMI](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B06VVYBLZZ) with Xilinx tools pre-installed and setup for development right away.

However, setting up an instance for development might require a few extra steps like 
* Setting up a GUI Desktop.
* Setting up a Runtime instance.
* Setting up a development environment that includes an elastic compute cluster.

This document guides developers to setting up their development environment for development, 
building/running/debugging designs and managing costs while doing so.

We have provided the following two ways of setting up your development environment:
* [Guide for creating a GUI Desktop for FPGA Development using NICE DCV and the FPGA Developer AMI](DCV.md)
* [Automated Deployment of a GUI Desktop and HPC cluster for FPGA Development based on NICE DCV and AWS ParallelCluster](DCV_with_ParallelCluster.md)
