## Release 1.4.0 (See [ERRATA](./ERRATA.md) for unsupported features)
* [New Shell Stable: v04261818](./hdk/common/shell_stable).  Starting with release v1.4.0, the AWS FPGA shell stable has been updated and only supports Xilinx 2017.4 SDx/Vivado.  All previous versions of tools and shells are not supported with this developer kit shell release. 
  * [Shell Release Notes](./hdk/docs/AWS_Shell_RELEASE_NOTES.md) 

* The previous shell (v071417d3) will be supported until 09/01/2018.  Developers are required to use the [developer kit v1.3.X branch](https://github.com/aws/aws-fpga/tree/REL_v1_3_8) for all shell version v071417d3 development.  

* Release 1.4.0 greatly improves the performance of the DMA (for interrupt driven DMA on the cl\_dram\_dma example design). This is accomplished through a combination of shell changes to relax DMA timeouts and a new XDMA software driver option.  We have ported the relevant HDK examples to the XDMA driver in this release. EDMA is still supported, and developers can freely choose which DMA driver to use as part of their host application.

## Previous release notes
## Release 1.3.X Details (See [ERRATA](./ERRATA.md) for unsupported features)

The following major features are included in this HDK release: 

### 1.    New Shell, with modified Shell/CL interface. Changes are covered in: 
* The floorplan has been enhanced to enable more optimal CL designs through better timing closure and reduced congestion at the CL to Shell interface.
* [AWS_Shell_Interface_Specification.md](./hdk/docs/AWS_Shell_Interface_Specification.md) has been updated.  See cl_ports.vh for the updated port list
* AWS Shell DCP is stored in S3 and fetched/verified when `hdk_setup.sh` script is sourced.

### 2.    Integrated DMA 
* DMA functionality has been enhanced to allow DMA transactions of up to 1MB.
* Multi-queue in each direction is now supported
* The DMA bus toward the CL is multiplexed over sh_cl_dma_pcis AXI4 interface so the same address space can be accessed via DMA or directly via PCIe AppPF BAR4 
* DMA usage is covered in the new [CL_DRAM_DMA example](./hdk/cl/examples/cl_dram_dma) RTL verification/simulation and Software 
* A corresponding AWS Elastic DMA ([EDMA](./sdk/linux_kernel_drivers/edma)) driver is provided.
* [EDMA Installation Readme](./sdk/linux_kernel_drivers/edma/edma_install.md) provides installation and usage guidelines
* See [Kernel_Drivers_README](./sdk/linux_kernel_drivers/README.md) for more information on restrictions for this release


### 3.    PCI-M
* The PCI-M interface is fully supported for CL generated transactions to the Shell. 

### 4.    URAM 
* Restrictions on URAM have been updated to enable 100% of the URAM with a CL to be utilized.  See documentation on enabling URAM utilization: [URAM_options](./hdk/docs/URAM_Options.md)

### 5.    Vivado IP Integrator (IPI) and GUI Workflow
* Vivado graphical design canvas and project-based flow is now supported.  This flow allows developers to create CL logic as either RTL or complex subsystems based on an IP centric block diagram.  Prior experience in RTL or system block designs is recommended.  The [IP Integrator and GUI Vivado workflow](hdk/docs/IPI_GUI_Vivado_Setup.md) enables a unified graphical environment to guide the developer through the common steps to design, implement, and verify FGPAs.  To get started, start with the [README that will take you through getting started steps and documents on IPI](hdk/docs/IPI_GUI_Vivado_Setup.md)
 
### 6.    Build Flow improvments
* See [Build_Scripts](./hdk/common/shell_v04261818/build/scripts)

### 7.    VHDL
* CL designs in VHDL are fully supported.  
See example for more details [CL_HELLO_WORLD_VHDL](./hdk/cl/examples/cl_hello_world_vhdl/README.md)

### 8.    AXI Interface Checking
* Protocol checks have been added to the CL-Shell interface to detect and report CL errors for enhanced CL debugging.
* Transaction timeout values on the CL-Shell interface have been increased to allow for longer CL response times.
* See [Shell_Interface_Specification](./hdk/docs/AWS_Shell_Interface_Specification.md)

### 9.    Support for Vivado 2017.1 SDX Build 

* The FPGA Development AMI includes Vivado 2017.1 SDX
    * Get the 1.3.0+ AMI by selecting the version from the [marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B06VVYBLZZ#). 
* Older Vivado versions will not be supported

### 10.    SDK changes 

* Synchronous (default) mode for fpga-load-local-image and fpga-clear-local-image.  For example, in synchronous mode (default) fpga-load-local-image will wait for the AFI to transition to the "loaded" state, perform a PCI device remove and recan in order to expose the unique AFI Vendor and Device Id, and display the final state for the given FPGA slot number.  Asynchronous operation is preserved with the "-A" option to both fpga-load-local-image and fpga-clear-local-image.
* The corresponding fpga_mgmt_load_local_image_sync and fpga_mgmt_clear_local_image_sync are provided by the fpga_mgmt library for use in C/C++ programs.

### Release 1.3.7 (See [ERRATA](./ERRATA.md) for unsupported features)

* The FPGA Development AMI includes Vivado 2017.1
* Older Vivado versions will not be supported

#### 24.    Embed the HDK version and Shell Version as part of the git tree

* [hdk_version.txt](./hdk/hdk_version.txt)
* [shell_version.txt](./hdk/common/shell_v04261818)

#### 25.    Initial Release of SDAccel and OpenCL Support (NA)

* Updated documentation in /sdk/SDAccel (NA)
* OpenCL runtime HAL for supporting SDAccel and OpenCL ICD in /sdk/userspace (NA)
* SDAccel build post-processing to register SDAccel xcl.bin as AFI. (NA) 

#### 26.    Simplify handling of unused Shell to CL interfaces

* Developers can simply call `include "unused\_**BUS\_NAME**\_template.inc" for every unused interface
* List of potential files to include is available in `$HDK_SHELL_DIR/design/interfaces/unused\*`
* cl_hello_world.sv and cl_dram_dma.sv provide examples (at the each of each file)

#### 27.    Support multiple Vivado versions

* `hdk_setup.sh` compares between the list of Vivado versions supported by the HDK and the installed vivado versions
* `hdk_setup.sh` would automatically choose the Vivado version from the available binaries in AWS FPGA Developer's AMI

#### 28.    Changes in DRAM controller setting to improve bandwidth utilization

* Change address decoding to ROW_COL_INTLV mode
* Enable auto precharge on COL A3
