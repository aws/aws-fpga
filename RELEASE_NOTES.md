## Release 1.3.0 New Features Details

The following major features are included in this HDK release: 

### 1.	New Shell, with modified Shell/CL interface. Changes are covered in: 
* The floorplan has been enhanced to enable more optimal CL designs through better timing closure and reduced congestion at the CL to Shell interface.
* [New Shell Stable: v071417d3](./hdk/common/shell_v071417d3)
* [AWS_Shell_Interface_Specification.md](./hdk/docs/AWS_Shell_Interface_Specification.md) has been updated.  See cl_ports.vh for the updated port list
* DCP for the latest shell v071417d3. AWS Shell DCP is stored in S3 and fetched/verified when `hdk_setup.sh` script is sourced.

### 2.	Integrated DMA 
* DMA functionality has been enhanced to allow DMA transactions of up to 1MB.
* Multi-queue in each direction is now supported
* The DMA bus toward the CL is multiplexed over sh_cl_dma_pcis AXI4 interface so the same address space can be accessed via DMA or directly via PCIe AppPF BAR4 
* DMA usage is covered in the new [CL_DRAM_DMA example](./hdk/cl/examples/cl_dram_dma) RTL verification/simulation and Software 
* A corresponding AWS Elastic DMA ([EDMA](./sdk/linux_kernel_drivers/edma)) driver is provided.
* [EDMA Installation Readme](./sdk/linux_kernel_drivers/edma/edma_install.md) provides installation and usage guidelines
* See [Kernel_Drivers_README](./sdk/linux_kernel_drivers/README.md) for more information on restrictions for this release


### 3.	PCI-M
* The PCI-M interface is fully supported for CL generated transactions to the Shell. 

### 4.	URAM 
* Restrictions on URAM have been updated to enable 100% of the URAM with a CL to be utilized.  See documentation on enabling URAM utilization: [URAM_options](./hdk/docs/URAM_Options.md)

### 5.	Vivado IP Integrator (IPI) and GUI Workflow
* Vivado graphical design canvas and project based flow is now supported.  This flow allows developers to create CL logic as either RTL or complex subsystems based on an IP centric block diagram.  Prior experience in RTL or system block designs is recommended.  The [IP Integrator and GUI Vivado workflow](README.md#ipi) enables a unified graphical environment to guide the developer through the common steps to design, implement, and verify FGPAs.  To get started, start with the [README that will take you through getting started steps and documents on IPI](README.md#ipi)
 
### 6.	Build Flow improvments
* See [Build_Scripts](./hdk/common/shell_v071417d3/build/scripts)

### 7.	VHDL
* CL designs in VHDL are fully supported.  
See example for more details [CL_HELLO_WORLD_VHDL](./hdk/cl/examples/cl_hello_world_vhdl/README.md)

### 8.	AXI Interface Checking
* Protocol checks have been added to the CL-Shell interface to detect and report CL errors for enhanced CL debugging.
* Transaction timeout values on the CL-Shell interface have been increased to allow for longer CL response times.
* See [Shell_Interface_Specification](./hdk/docs/AWS_Shell_Interface_Specification.md)

### 9.	Support for Vivado 2017.1 SDX Build 

* The FPGA Development AMI includes Vivado 2017.1 SDX
    * Get the 1.3.0+ AMI by selecting the version from the [marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B06VVYBLZZ#). 
* Older Vivado versions will not be supported

### 10.	SDK changes 

* Synchronous (default) mode for fpga-load-local-image and fpga-clear-local-image.  For example, in synchronous mode (default) fpga-load-local-image will wait for the AFI to transition to the "loaded" state, perform a PCI device remove and recan in order to expose the unique AFI Vendor and Device Id, and display the final state for the given FPGA slot number.  Asynchronous operation is preserved with the "-A" option to both fpga-load-local-image and fpga-clear-local-image.
* The corresponding fpga_mgmt_load_local_image_sync and fpga_mgmt_clear_local_image_sync are provided by the fpga_mgmt library for use in C/C++ programs.

## Supported Tools and Environment

* The HDK and SDK are designed for **Linux** environment and has not been tested on other platforms
* First installation of AWS FPGA SDK requires having gcc installed in the instance server. If that's not available, try `sudo yum update && sudo yum group install "Development Tools"`
* The HDK build step requires having Xilinx's Vivado tool and Vivado License Management running.  Tools and licenses are provided with AWS FPGA Developer AMI at no additional cost
* This release is tested and validated with Xilinx 2017.1 SDX (Vivado)
* Developers that choose to not use the developer AMI in AWS EC2, need to have Xilinx license 'EF-VIVADO-SDX-VU9P-OP' installed on premises.  For more help, please refer to [On-premise licensing help](./hdk/docs/on_premise_licensing_help.md)
* Vivado XSIM RTL simulator supported by the HDK
* MentorGraphic's Questa RTL simulator supported by the HDK (but requires a purchase of separate license from MentorGraphics)
* Synopsys' VCS RTL simulator supported by the HDK (but requires a purchase of separate license from Synopsys)

* DCP for the latest shell v04151701. AWS Shell DCP is stored in S3 and fetched/verified when `hdk_setup.sh` script is sourced.


#### 2.	Integrated DMA in Beta Release. AWS Shell now includes DMA capabilities on behalf of the CL
* The DMA bus toward the CL is multiplexed over sh_cl_dma_pcis AXI4 interface so the same address space can be accessed via DMA or directly via PCIe AppPF BAR4 
* DMA usage is covered in the new [CL_DRAM_DMA example](./hdk/cl/examples/cl_dram_dma) RTL verification/simulation and Software 
* A corresponding AWS Elastic DMA ([EDMA](./sdk/linux_kernel_drivers/edma)) driver is provided.

* The initial release supports a single queue in each direction
* DMA support is in Beta stage with a known issue for DMA READ transactions that cross 4K address boundaries.  See [Kernel_Drivers_README](./sdk/linux_kernel_drivers/README.md) for more information on restrictions for this release

#### 5.	Decoupling Shell/CL interface clocking from the internal Shell Clock 

* All the Shell/CL interfaces running off clk_main_a0, and no longer required to be 250Mhz. 
* The default frequency using the HDK build flow for `clk_main_a0` is 125Mhz as specified in recipe number A0. Allowing CL designs to have flexible frequency and not be constrained to 250Mhz only. All CL designs must include the recipe number in the manifest.txt file in order to generate an AFI.
* All xdc scripts have been updated to clk_main_a0 and to reference a table with the possible clocks’ frequencies combinations
* Updated CL_HELLO_WORLD and CL_DRAM_DMA examples to use the `clk_main_a0` 

#### 6.	Additional User-defined Auxiliary Clocks
Additional tunable auxiliary clocks are generated by the Shell and fed to the CL. The clocks frequencies are set by choosing a clock recipe per group from a set of predefined frequencies combination in [clock recipes table](./hdk/docs/clock_recipes.csv)

* Clock frequency selection is set during build time, and recorded in the manifest.txt (which should include the clock_recipe_a/b/c parameters)
