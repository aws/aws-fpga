## OpenCL Development Environment with Amazon EC2 F1 FPGA Instances to accelerate your C/C++ applications

Today (9/13/17), We are very excited to announce the general availability of the OpenCL Development Environment with Amazon EC2 F1 FPGA Instances to accelerate your C/C++ applications. Software developers with little to no FPGA experience, will find a familiar development experience and now can use the cloud-scale availability of FPGAs to supercharge their applications.
The AWS FPGA Developer Kit has 50+ examples to help you get started on FPGA acceleration using SDAccel. To get started, review the Developer Kit README: https://github.com/aws/aws-fpga/blob/master/SDAccel/README.md
