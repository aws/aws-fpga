# AWS EC2 FPGA Hardware and Software Development Kits 

This release includes two portions: [HDK](./hdk) for developing Amazon FPGA Image (AFI),  and [SDK](./sdk) for using AFIs on FPGA-enabled EC2 instances [such as F1](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/f1/).

Execute `git clone https://github.com/aws/aws-fpga.git` to download this HDK+SDK release to your EC2 Instance or local server.
For an SSH connection execute `git clone git@github.com:aws/aws-fpga.git`. [To get help with connecting to Github via SSH](https://help.github.com/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/)

The [Release Notes](./RELEASE_NOTES.md) document covers the list of supported features, programming environment, and known restrictions.

**NOTE: The HDK and SDK are tested and supported for Linux operating systems, for the time being, other OSs haven't been tested by AWS**

## FPGA HDK 

The [HDK directory](./hdk) contains useful information and scripts for developers wanting to start building Amazon FPGA Images (AFI).  It includes the development environment, simulation, build and AFI creation scripts.  The HDK can be installed on any on-premises server or an EC2 instance. The HDK is not required if you are using a pre-built AFI and not planning to build your own AFI. The following resources provide further details:

[HDK README](./hdk/README.md)
        
[AWS FPGA Shell Interface Specification](./hdk/docs/AWS_Shell_Interface_Specification.md)
        
[FPGA PCIe Address Map](./hdk/docs/AWS_Fpga_Pcie_Memory_Map.md)

## Vivado HLx 

The Vivado HLx allows users to use Vivado in project mode to create designs or import designs using RTL or IP Integrator flows.
The below documentation covers the setup, tutorials of RTL/IP Integrator flows and FAQ.  Users are recommended to read all documents before starting any design.

[HLx Setup README](./hdk/docs/AWS_IP_Vivado_Setup.md)

[HLx Flows](./hdk/docs/AWS_Vivado_Flows.md)

## FPGA SDK

The [SDK directory](./sdk) includes the runtime environment required to run on EC2 FPGA instances. It includes the drivers and tools to manage the AFIs that are loaded to EC2 FPGA instance slots. The SDK isn't required during the AFI development process; it is only required once an AFI is loaded onto an EC2 FPGA instance. The following resources provide further details:

[SDK README](./sdk/README.md)

[Access FPGA From Linux Applications](./hdk/docs/Programmer_View.md)

[AFI Management Tools](./sdk/userspace/fpga_mgmt_tools/README.md)

## FPGA Developer AMI 

AWS Marketplace offers the [FPGA developer AMI](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B06VVYBLZZ) for development on EC2 instances. The FPGA Developer AMI comes with Xilinx tools and AWS CLI pre-installed.  The HDK examples and quick start can be run on any [C4/M4/R4/T2.2XLARGE](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/) EC2 instance. Given the large size of the FPGA used in AWS FPGA instances, the implementation tools require 32GiB Memory (C4.4XLarge, M4.2XLarge, R4.XLarge, T2.2XLarge). C4.4XLarge and C4.8XLarge would provide the fastest execution time with 30 and 60GiB of memory respectively.

# Building a Custom Logic AFI for AWS FPGA Instances

Developers can build their own Custom Logic (CL) and deploy it on AWS.
The CL must comply with the [AWS Shell Interface Specifications](./hdk/docs/AWS_Shell_Interface_Specification.md), and pass through the build scripts.

The [CL Examples directory](./hdk/cl/examples) is provided to assist developers in creating a functional CL implementation. Each example includes:

1. The source code for the example under the `/design` directory.
2. The timing, clock and placement constraints files, scripts for compiling the example design. (This requires running in an instance/server that have Xilinx tools and license installed. Developers are recommended to use the FPGA Development AMI available free of charge on [AWS Marketplace](#devAmi)).
3. The final build, called Design Checkpoint (DCP) that can be submitted for AWS to generate the AFI.
4. An AFI-ID for a pre-generated AFI that matches the example design.
5. Software source code required on the FPGA-enabled instance to run the example.
6. Software binary that can be loaded on an FPGA-enabled instance to test the AFI.

In summary:

- An AFI can be created using the files in #1, #2, and #3. The AFI creation can take place on any EC2 instance or on-premises.
- The AFI can be used in an EC2 F1 instance by using the files in #4, #5 and #6.

By following the example CLs, a developer will learn how to interface to the AWS Shell of the FPGA, compile the source code to create an AFI, and load/run an AFI from the F1 instance for use.

### Prerequisites
* AWS FPGA HDK and SDK run in Linux environment only.

* The build stage uses Xilinx's Vivado tool set. In case you build on-premises you should have an installed Vivado that has the correct license.  Please check for [supported versions of Vivado](./hdk/supported_vivado_versions.txt). [Release Notes](./RELEASE_NOTES.md) may contain additional information.
* Executing `aws s3 <action>` and `aws ec2 create-fpga-image` require having AWS CLI installed, having an active AWS account, and the server/instance has been configured with your credentials and the same AWS region as your S3 bucket via `aws configure` command line. It’s also required that your instance and the S3 bucket where the tarball reside in will be in the same AWS region.  Please refer to [AWS documentation for help with configuring the AWS CLI.](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html)   

The [Getting started with CL examples](./hdk/cl/examples/README.md) guide provides step-by-step instructions to build an AFI from one of the provided examples, register it with AWS, and load it on an EC2 FPGA instance.

## Using an AFI on EC2 FPGA Instances
Now that you have built an AFI, or if you want to use one of the example pre-built AFIs provided by AWS, you need to launch an EC2 FGPA Instance, and install the SDK as detailed at: [SDK Quick Start](./sdk/README.md)
