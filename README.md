# Overview of AWS EC2 FPGA Development Kit

AWS EC2 FPGA Development Kit is a set of development and runtime tools to develop, simulate, debug, compile and run hardware accelerated applications on [Amazon EC2 F1 instances](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/f1/).
It is distributed between this github repository and FPGA Developer AMI - [Centos](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B06VVYBLZZ)/[AL2](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B08NTMMZ7X) provided by AWS with no cost of development tools.

‚ö†Ô∏è <b>NOTE:</b> The developer kit is supported for Linux operating systems only.

## Development Flow
After creating an FPGA design (also called CL - Custom logic), developers can create an Amazon FPGA Image (AFI) and easily deploy it to an F1 instance. AFIs are reusable, shareable and can be deployed in a scalable and secure way.

## Development Environments

| Development Environment | Description | Accelerator Language | Hardware Interface | Debug Options| Typical Developer |
| --------|---------|-------|---------|-------|-------|
| Software Defined Accelerator Development using [Vitis](Vitis/README.md)/[SDAccel](SDAccel/README.md)| Development experience leverages an optimized compiler to allow easy new accelerator development or migration of existing C/C++/openCL, Verilog/VHDL to AWS FPGA instances | C/C++/OpenCL, Verilog/VHDL (RTL) | OpenCL APIs and XRT | SW/HW Emulation, Simulation, GDB, Virtual JTAG (Chipscope) | SW or HW Developer with zero FPGA experience |
| [Hardware Accelerator Development using Vivado](hdk/README.md) | Fully custom hardware development experience provides hardware developers with the tools required for developing AFIs for AWS FPGA instances  | Verilog/VHDL | [XDMA Driver](sdk/linux_kernel_drivers/xdma/README.md), [peek/poke](sdk/userspace/README.md) | Simulation, Virtual JTAG | HW Developer with advanced FPGA experience |
| [IP Integrator/High Level Design(HLx) using Vivado](hdk/docs/IPI_GUI_Vivado_Setup.md) | Graphical interface development experience for integrating IP and high level synthesis development | Verilog/VHDL/C | [XDMA Driver](sdk/linux_kernel_drivers/xdma/README.md), [peek/poke](sdk/userspace/README.md) | Simulation, Virtual JTAG | HW Developer with intermediate FPGA experience |

> For on-premise development, SDAccel/Vitis/Vivado must have the [correct license and use one of the supported tool versions](./docs/on_premise_licensing_help.md). 

## FPGA Developer AMI

The [FPGA Developer AMI](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B06VVYBLZZ) is available on the AWS marketplace without a software charge and includes tools needed for developing FPGA Designs to run on AWS F1. 

Given the large size of the FPGA used inside AWS F1 Instances, Xilinx tools work best with 32GiB Memory. 
z1d.xlarge/c5.4xlarge and z1d.2xlarge/c5.8xlarge instance types would provide the fastest execution time with 30GiB+ and 60GiB+ of memory respectively. 
Developers who want to save on cost, could start coding and run simulations on low-cost instances, like t2.2xlarge, and move to the aforementioned larger instances to run the synthesis of their acceleration code.

AWS marketplace offers multiple versions of the FPGA Developer AMI. The following section table describes the mapping of currently supported developer kit versions to AMI versions.

## Xilinx tool support

## Hardware Development Kit (HDK)

The [HDK directory](./hdk/README.md) contains documentation, examples, simulation, build and AFI creation scripts to start building Amazon FPGA Images (AFI).  
The HDK can be installed on any on-premises server or an EC2 instance. 
The developer kit is not required if you plan to use a pre-built AFI shared from another developer.

### AWS Shells

With Amazon EC2 FPGA instances, each FPGA is divided into two partitions:

* Shell (SH) ‚Äì AWS platform logic implementing the FPGA external peripherals, PCIe, DRAM, and Interrupts.

* Custom Logic (CL) ‚Äì Custom acceleration logic created by an FPGA Developer.

At the end of the development process, combining the Shell and CL creates an Amazon FPGA Image (AFI) that can be loaded onto the Amazon EC2 FPGA Instances.

The following table provides the shells currently available to develop your CL with. Each shell provides specific interfaces and features and currently needs to be used with the Dev Kit branch listed in the table.

| Shell Name| Shell Version | Dev Kit Branch | Description|
|--------|--------|---------|-------|
| F1 XDMA Shell | F1.X.1.4 | [master](https://github.com/aws/aws-fpga/) | Provides all the [interfaces listed here](https://github.com/aws/aws-fpga/blob/master/hdk/docs/AWS_Shell_Interface_Specification.md), includes DMA | 
| F1 Small Shell | F1.S.1.0 | [small_shell](https://github.com/aws/aws-fpga/tree/small_shell) | Provides all the [interfaces listed here](https://github.com/aws/aws-fpga/blob/small_shell/hdk/docs/AWS_Shell_Interface_Specification.md). This shell does not include DMA engine and provides significant reduction in Shell resource usage. |

For more details, check the [FAQ](./FAQs.md#general-aws-fpga-shell-faqs)

## Software-defined Development Environment

The software-defined development environment allows customers to compile their C/C++/OpenCL code into the FPGA as kernels, and use OpenCL APIs to pass data to the FPGA. 
Software developers with no FPGA experience will find a familiar development experience that supercharges cloud applications.

In addition, this development environment allows for a mix of C/C++ and RTL accelerator designs into a C/C++ software based development environment. This method enables faster prototyping using C/C++ while supporting manual optimization of critical blocks within RTL. This approach is similar to optimizing time critical functions using software compiler optimization methods.

To get started with Xilinx SDAccel, review the [Software-defined development environment readme](SDAccel/README.md).
To get started with Xilinx Vitis, review the [Vitis unified development environment readme](Vitis/README.md).

## Runtime Tools (SDK)

The [SDK directory](./sdk/README.md) includes the runtime environment required to run on EC2 FPGA instances. It includes the drivers and tools to manage the AFIs that are loaded on the FPGA instance. The SDK isn't required during the AFI development process; it is only required once an AFI is loaded onto an EC2 FPGA instance. The following sdk resources are provided:
  * Linux Kernel Drivers - The developer kit includes three drivers:
    * [XDMA Driver](sdk/linux_kernel_drivers/xdma/README.md) - DMA interface to/from HDK accelerators.
  * [FPGA Libraries](sdk/userspace/fpga_libs) - APIs used by C/C++ host applications.
  * [FPGA Management Tools](sdk/userspace/fpga_mgmt_tools/README.md) - AFI management APIs for runtime loading/clearing FPGA image, gathering metrics and debug interface on the F1 instance.

# Getting Started

### Getting familiar with AWS
If you have never used AWS before, we recommend you start with [AWS getting started training](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/), and focus on the basics of the [AWS EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) and [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) services. 
Understanding the fundamentals of these services will make it easier to work with AWS F1 and the FPGA Developer Kit.

FPGA Image generation and EC2 F1 instances are supported in the us-east-1 (N. Virginia), us-west-2 (Oregon), eu-west-1 (Ireland) and us-gov-west-1 ([GovCloud US](https://aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us/)) [regions](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/).

> ‚ö†Ô∏è <b>NOTE:</b> By default, your AWS Account will have an EC2 F1 Instance launch limit of 0. 
> Before using F1 instances, you will have to open a [Support Case](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create) to increase the EC2 Instance limits to allow launching F1 instances.

### Setting up development environment for the first time 

You have the choice to develop on AWS EC2 using the [FPGA Developer AMI](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B06VVYBLZZ) or on-premise. 

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è <b>INFO:</b> We suggest starting with the FPGA Developer AMI with [build instances](#fpga-developer-ami) on EC2 as it has Xilinx tools and licenses setup for you to be able to quickly get into development.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è <b>INFO:</b> For on-premise development, you will need to have [Xilinx tools and licenses available for you to use](./docs/on_premise_licensing_help.md)

1. Start a Build Instance first to start your development. 
    > üí° <b>TIP:</b> This instance does not have to be an F1 instance. You only require an F1 instance to run your AFI's(Amazon FPGA Image) once you have gone through your design build and AFI creation steps.
    
    > ‚ÑπÔ∏è <b>INFO:</b> If you need to follow GUI Development flows, please checkout our [Developer Resources](./developer_resources/README.md) where we provide Step-By-Step guides to setting up a GUI Desktop.
1. Clone the [FPGA Developer Kit](https://github.com/aws/aws-fpga) on your instance.
    ```git clone https://github.com/aws/aws-fpga.git```
1. Follow the quickstarts from the next section.
