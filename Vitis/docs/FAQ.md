# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## Q: What is the lowest frequency Vitis design supported on the AWS F1 Platform?
A: We support creating AFI's from CL's that have been built to work at Frequencies no lower than 80MHz.
   Re-clocking/Loading a dynamic clock frequency lower than 80MHz will also result in an error.
